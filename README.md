# Intro

A remote multi server automation tool (like Capistrano/Fabric) in Clojure.

# Goals and motivation
 
 * A clear roles to host matching model which can be extended easily.
 
 * Can be used both as a library and as a standalone tool.

 * An easy to follow Clojure DSL. 

 * Functional interface.

 * Inspired by Capistrano but more flexible.
